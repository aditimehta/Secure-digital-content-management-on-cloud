# Secure-digital-content-management-on-cloud

Designed a cloud based application that provides security to the digital data using geo-location based encryption. It uses the location of the receiver along with a self-generated key to encrypt the data. This encrypted data is then stored on the google cloud and the receiver can decrypt the file using its location and the key that is shared by the sender.
